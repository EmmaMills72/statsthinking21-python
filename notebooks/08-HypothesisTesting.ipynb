    "Let's say that we flipped 100 coins and observed 70 heads. We would like to use these data to test the hypothesis that the true probability is 0.5.\n",
    "First let's generate our data, simulating 100,000 sets of 100 flips. We use such a large number because it turns out that it's very rare to get 70 heads, so we need many attempts in order to get a reliable estimate of these probabilties.  This will take a couple of minutes to complete."

We will then count how often we reject the null hypothesis; since we know that the true mean is zero, these are by definition Type I errors.\n",
